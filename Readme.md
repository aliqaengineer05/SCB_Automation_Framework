# Mobile Automation Testing Framework

This project is a mobile automation testing framework using **Robot Framework**, **Appium**, and **Python**. It is designed to perform automated tests on mobile applications following a modular structure with **Page Object Model (POM)** and reusable keywords. It also integrates **Allure Reports** for better test result reporting.

   - Download and install JDK from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html).
   - Set the `JAVA_HOME` and update `PATH`:
     ```bash
     export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
     export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
     ```

4. **Android Studio** (version 4.x or above)
   - Download and install Android Studio from [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio).
   - Set up an Android Emulator or connect a real Android device.
   - Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable:
     ```bash
     export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/your/android/sdk
     export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH
     ```

5. **PyCharm** (IDE recommended for managing the project)
   - Download from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

6. **Allure Framework** (for test reporting)
   - Install Allure Commandline using Homebrew (macOS):
     ```bash
     brew install allure
     ```
   - For Windows/Linux, follow the installation steps on [Allure’s GitHub](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2).

## Setup Guide

Follow the steps below to set up the framework:

### 1. Install Python
- Download and install Python 3.7 or above from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- Add Python to the system `PATH` during installation.

### 2. Install Appium
Install Appium globally using npm:
```bash
npm install -g appium

###  3. Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Download and install JDK from Oracle.
- Set up JAVA_HOME and update PATH as shown in the Prerequisites section.

###  4. Install Android Studio
- Download and install Android Studio from developer.android.com.
- Set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable as shown in the Prerequisites section.

### 5. Install Python Libraries
Install the required Python libraries by running:

```pip install -r requirements.txt

### 6. Set Up Robot Framework
- Install Robot Framework and AppiumLibrary:
```pip install robotframework
```pip install robotframework-appiumlibrary


### 7. Configure Appium
After installing Appium, you can start the Appium server by running:
appium

### 8. Install Allure Integration
Install the Robot Framework Allure listener:

```pip install robotframework-allure


Folder Structure
Here’s a breakdown of the folder structure of the project:
###

├── /tests                      # Test cases organized by type (regression, sanity, etc.)
│   ├── /regression             # Regression tests
│   ├── /sanity                 # Sanity tests
│   ├── /smoke                  # Smoke tests
│   └── /common                 # Common test cases

└── /allure-results/            # Allure Results

Running Tests

You can run the tests using Robot Framework. Navigate to the /tests directory and execute:

```robot --listener allure_robotframework ./tests
This will run the tests and generate Allure-compatible results in the /allure-results/ folder.

CI Integration
Jenkins
Add a post-build action in Jenkins to display the Allure report:

### Groovy
post {
    always {
        allure includeProperties: false, jdk: '', results: [[path: 'allure-results']]
    }
}

### GitHub Actions
Use the following GitHub Actions YAML file to run the tests and generate Allure reports:

- name: Run Robot Framework Tests
  run: |
    robot --listener allure_robotframework ./tests

- name: Generate Allure Report
  run: |
    allure serve allure-results/

### Test Reports
After running the tests, Robot Framework generates the output directory containing the test reports:

Log.html: Detailed log of the test execution.
Report.html: High-level summary of the test run.
Output.xml: Raw XML output.
Allure also provides a web-based report, which can be generated and served:

allure serve allure-results/
Priority & Severity Annotations
Test cases can be annotated with Priority and Severity to indicate their importance and criticality:

Severity levels: blocker, critical, major, minor, trivial
Priority levels: high, medium, low
Example usage:

robot
[Allure.severity]   critical
[Allure.priority]   high
Conclusion
This framework provides a modular approach to mobile test automation using Robot Framework, Appium, and Python, with enhanced reporting via Allure. By utilizing the Page Object Model (POM) and custom reusable keywords, the tests are maintainable and scalable. Allure integration adds detailed reporting and visual insights into the execution results.

Feel free to extend this framework by adding more tests, keywords, or page objects based on your application's needs.
